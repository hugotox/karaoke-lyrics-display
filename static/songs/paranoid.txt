Finished with my woman 'cause she <br>couldn't help me with my mind
people think I'm insane because <br>I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things <br>but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't <br>find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the <br>things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make <br>true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and <br>you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and <br>love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words <br>telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish <br>I could but it's too late
