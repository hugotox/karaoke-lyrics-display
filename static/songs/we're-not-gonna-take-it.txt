We're Not Gonna Take It
We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore

We've got the right to choose and there ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight the powers that be just, don't pick our destiny 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong

Oh, you're so condescending, your gall is never ending
We don't want nothin', not a thing, from you
Your life is trite and jaded, boring and confiscated
If that's your best, your best won't do

Oh
Oh
We're right, yeah
We're free, yeah
We'll fight, yeah
You'll see, yeah

We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore

No way

Oh
Oh
We're right, yeah
We're free, yeah
We'll fight, yeah
You'll see, yeah

We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore

We're not gonna take it (no)
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore (just you try and make us)

We're not gonna take it (come on)
No, we ain't gonna take it (you're all worthless and weak)
We're not gonna take it anymore (now drop and give me twenty)

We're not gonna take it (a pledge pin)
No, we ain't gonna take it (on your uniform)
We're not gonna take it anymore
