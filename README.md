**Motivation**

I play guitar on a karaoke rock band, and handing printed lyrics to the public sucks. Playing with a backing track and synced lyrics
kinda works but we lose freedom of live playing. 
By using this lyrics display with a footpedal to make clicks allows us to give a true live karaoke band experience.
